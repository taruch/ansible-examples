There are two playbooks in this repo - one for exporting from an AAP 2.4 instance, and one to import to an AAP 2.5 instance.

To do an export from an Ansible Automation Platform 2.4 system, export the variables defined in the playbook vars (at the top)
export CONTROLLER_VERIFY_SSL=<true or false>
export CONTROLLER_HOST=<FQDN of 2.4 controller>
export CONTROLLER_PASSWORD=<password>
export CONTROLLER_USERNAME=<username>

You may need to install the relevant collections:
ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml -p ./collections --force

Run the playbook:
ansible-navigator run -mstdout filetree_export_24.yml -vvv --eei=quay.io/acme_corp/product-demos-ee --penv=CONTROLLER_USERNAME --penv=CONTROLLER_PASSWORD --penv=CONTROLLER_HOST --penv=CONTROLLER_VERIFY_SSL


To import to an Automation Platform 2.5 system, export the variables defined in the playbook vars for the AAP 2.5 system.

Run the playbook:
ansible-navigator run -mstdout filetree_import_25.yml -vvv --eei=quay.io/ansible-product-demos/apd-ee-25:latest --penv=CONTROLLER_USERNAME --penv=CONTROLLER_PASSWORD --penv=CONTROLLER_HOST --penv=CONTROLLER_VERIFY_SSL



Issues:
If you had resources in the 2.4 system that were not assigned to an organization, you will run into issues importing those resources into the AAP 2.5 system.  You have a couple choices.
- Fix them in your 2.4 instance before you do the export (best)
- Change the ORGANIZATIONLESS resources to a viable organization (works): find ./<export directory> -type f -exec sed -i 's/ORGANIZATIONLESS/Default/g' {} +
- Remove the ORGANIZATIONLESS resources (probably not what you are looking for)

- Also be aware that if you overwrite a credential that you require (such as an Ansible Hub) for syncing collections, that can be a problem.  It might be a good idea to delete those, or to fix them.
