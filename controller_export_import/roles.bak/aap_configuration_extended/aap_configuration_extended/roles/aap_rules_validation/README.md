# aap_rules_validation

An ansible role which audit the declared AAP configuration and validate it against a set of user-defined rules.

At the end of the role's execution, a structured data list and human readable report are generated containing the detected violations.

The actual version of the role supports only the controller component

## Requirements

n/a

## Role Input Variables

| Variable Name | Default Value | Required | Description |
| :------------ | :-----------: | :------: | :---------- |
| `aap_rules` | `[]`     | yes      | The list of rules to enforce on the declared configuration |
| `fail_if_violations_found` | `true` | no  | Force the role to fails if if it finds violations  |
| `print_rules_violations_data` | `true` | no  | Print the detailed violation data before printing the violation messages  |
| `audited_objects` | a list of all the objet types | no  | The objects to be audited. See the roles defaults main.yml file for the complete list  |
| `warn_about_audited_types_not_in_rules_objects` | `false` | no | Treat the objects to be audited but are not in any rule as a violation |
| `warn_about_rules_objects_not_in_audited_types` | `false` | no | Treat the objects that are defined in rules are not in the audited objects list as a violation  |

## Role Output Variables

| Variable Name |  Description |
| :------------ |  :---------- |
| `rules_violations_data`  | a list of dictionaries containing all the found rules violation details    |
| `rules_violations_msgs`  | a list of all the found rules violation messages |

### rules_violations_msgs format

Each `rules_violations_msgs` list element has the following syntax :

```markdown
Rule ID | Object Type | Object Scope | Object Name | Violation message related to this specific object"
```

Example of `rules_violations_msgs` :

```json
fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {
    "rules_violations_msgs | unique": [
        "Rule n°1 | organizations | global | Satellite | max_hosts is not set",
        "Rule n°2 | organizations | global | Default | The EE (Automation Hub Default Execution Environment) is forbidden.",
        "Rule n°3 | projects | Default | Test Project 3 | The value of the field name (Test Project 3) do not respect the regex (^\\[Default\\].*)",
        "Rule n°4 | groups | global | group3 | The mandatory field 'description' is not defined"
    ]
}
```

### rules_violations_data structure

Each `rules_violations_data` list element contains the following elements :

| Sub-element Name |  Description |
| :------------ |  :---------- |
| `msg`  | The violation message relative to this object. Same format as in `rules_violations_msgs` |
| `object_name`  | Name of the non-compliant object |
| `object_organization`  | Name of the organization to which belong the affected object if available. |
| `object_scope`  | Scope of the non-compliant object, one of two values : `global` or `organization` |
| `object_type`  | Type of the non-compliant object |
| `rule_broken`  | The rule not respected by the non-compliant object |
| `rule_id`  | Rule name if available otherwise the rule order (index + 1) |
| `rule_index`  | Index of rule (starting from 0) |

Example of `rules_violations_data` :

```json
"rules_violations_data | unique": [
    {
        "msg": "Rule n°1 | organizations | global | Satellite | max_hosts is not set",
        "object_name": "Satellite",
        "object_organization": "__undefined_org__",
        "object_scope": "global",
        "object_type": "organizations",
        "rule_broken": "max_hosts_per_organization",
        "rule_id": "n°1",
        "rule_index": 0
    },
    ...
```

## Rules

The rules should be defined as a list in the variable `aap_rules`

Each element of the list is a rule that is audited seperately

There is generic rules fields which are object-type-agnostic and other fields that are applicable to specific object type

### Generic Rules

| Variable Name | Type     | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :---------- |
| `rule_name`   |  string   | A descriptive string set by the user to better identify the rule  |
| `organizations` | list     | Limit the audit to the objects belonging to the organizations specified in this list. Not applicable to every rule. See the rules below for mor details.  |
| `objects`   | list   | The object types to be audited  |
| `exceptions` | dictionary   | The specific objects to be discarded from the audit. Applicable only to specific rules. See specific rules details below.  |
| `mandatory_fields`  | list   | The fields that are mandatory. It is a violation if they are empty or undefined. At the moment, `organizations` is ineffective with this rule. |
| `minimum_defined_globally`  | integer   | The minimum objects count allowed to be defined globally for the objects specified in `objects` |
| `maximum_defined_globally`  | integer   | The maximum objects count allowed to be defined globally for the objects specified in `objects` |
| `minimum_defined_per_org`  | integer   | The minimum objects count allowed to be defined in the organizations specified in `organizations` for the objects specified in `objects` |
| `maximum_defined_per_org`  | integer   | The maximum objects count allowed to be defined in the organizations specified in `organizations` for the objects specified in `objects` |
| `fields_regex`  | dictionary  | control if the fields of the objects defined in `objects` respect the declared regular expression. The dictionary keys are the fields to be monitored and the values are the corresponding regex. See examples below. |

    max_hosts_per_organization: 100
    allowed_organization_default_environments:
      - Automation Hub Default Execution Environment
      - Custom EE
```

##### Organizations specific rules example 2 : Deny only the specified EEs and allow everything else

```yaml

  - objects:
      - organizations
    max_hosts_per_organization: 10
    forbidden_organization_default_environments:
      - Automation Hub Default Execution Environment
    exceptions:
      organizations:
        - Satellite
```

#### Inventories

The following rule is specific to the inventories. However it needs both `controller_hosts` and `controller_inventories` to be defined to work correctly.

The inventories specific rules are compatible with the `exceptions` field

| Variable Name | Type     | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :---------- |
| `max_hosts_per_inventory`   |  integer   | The maximum hosts count allowed for the organization  |

##### Inventories specific rules examples

```yaml
aap_rules:

  - organizations:
      - Satellite
      - Default
    objects:
      - inventories
    max_hosts_per_inventory: 10  # needs 'controller_hosts' and 'controller_inventories' to be defined
    exceptions:
      inventories:
        - localhost
```

#### Hosts

The following rule is specific to hosts. However it needs both `controller_groups` and `controller_hosts` to be defined to work correctly.

| Variable Name | Type     | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :---------- |
| `allow_ungrouped_hosts`|  boolean | Set to `true` to flag ungrouped hosts as violations  |

##### Hosts specific rules examples

```yaml
aap_rules:

  # ------- Rule n°7 # Hosts
  - objects:
      - hosts
    allow_ungrouped_hosts: false  # needs 'controller_groups' and 'controller_hosts' to be defined
```

**Important Note**: The sensitive data encryption check **will not work** if the credentials transit through intermediary variables, like when the `filetree_read` role is used.

##### Credentials specific rules examples

```yaml
aap_rules:

  # ------- Rule n°8  # Credentials
  - encrypt_credentials_sensitive_data: true              # DO NOT WORK with intermediary variables (filetree_read)

```

#### Roles

The following rules are specific to roles.

| Variable Name | Type     | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :---------- |
| `allowed_roles`|  dictionary   | The allowed objects roles. Any role not explicitly listed in this dictionary will be flagged as a violation. The dictionary keys are the object types and the values are the list of the allowed roles. See the example below.   |
